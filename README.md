# pocket-kitten

I'm new to github and don't really know how to use it!

I uploaded 2 zip files containing all my game source files (Godot 3.5.1 project). Just unzip all the files into one directory and import into Godot 3.5.1.

The game can also be played online / download installers for Mac or Windows at https://mellowminx.itch.io/pocket-kitten
